i: For my topic, I chose to do some searces about car scenes in various large cities accross the U.S. I used city names
  (Seattle 1, Miami 2, Denver 3) to vary the search by region. The keywords I searched with were; car, car scene, race, and car meet.
  
ii: I wanted to make this comparison because I've always been interested in cars, and geographical patterns surrounding
  cars fascinate me. 
  
iii: Some patterns that I saw accross all 3 wordclouds are the words race, street, city, winner, supercross, elect. Seattle had a few unique     words, such as seafare and monster. Miami had a bunch of words related to formula 1. Denver had a bunch of words surrounding politics.

iv: Seattle's seafare has some very popular hydroplane racing, so it doesn't surprise me that seafare made multiple appearances. Monster         Energy is a major sponsor of motorsports events, so it is strange not to see it represented in the other wordclouds. There was a recent         formula 1 race in Miami, so the patterns make sense for that. Denver has a lot of political words, which is kind of strange considering the     other cities did not. 

v: My research could be improved with my keywords. My searces turned up with a lot of topics outside of automotive racing, such as dirtbikes,     boats, and political races. In the future, I will narrow down my keywords to be more specific.

vi: The variance in data sets really sticks out to me. I expected the patterns to be consistent accross each city, however, there are pattterns   unique to the different cities that I was not expecting.
